Before you release your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

To do this, you can either add your release key credentials to your existing key, or create a new key.

Once you have your key , replace the "Put your key" string in the file: /app/src/main/assets/k_9.html
	k_me.html etc.. html file
	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?key=put your key&sensor=false&callback=initialize" async defer></script>
